# Color Web

## Start here
Welcome! Start by launching the VSCode live server (CTRL-SHIFT-P and write *live server*). View the webpage in its current status. As you can see it is pink. But we want to make this page interactive!

## Your mission
Update `index.js` so that the webpage asks the user for a color when it loads,
and then sets the text and color accordingly

## When you are done
Take a few minutes and experiment, can you change something else? Maybe change another CSS property? Or add another DOM-element?
