# Color-DOM

## Start here
Begin with launching the VSCode live server and view the webpage and its current status

## Your mission
Update `index.js` so that the webpage asks the user for a color when it loads,
and then sets the text and color accordingly

## When you are done
Take a few minutes and experiment, can you change something else? Maybe change another CSS property? Or add another DOM-element?
